# OpenGL Projects
This repo serves as a unified VS solution which contains basic OpenGL projects. 
Mostly used for learning opengl from [https://learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).

The property sheet file (.props) should be added to each c++ project added to the solution, this will link OpenGL.lib, GLFW.lib, GLFW source and includes, and GLAD includes.
(If you are not me, you will need to change the directories that it grabes these files from more than likely.)

Make sure you add glad.c to each project (This can probably be done with property sheet as well but I never got it working for some reason.)
